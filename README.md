## Introduction

In modern software development, handling exceptions properly is crucial. This repository provides a structured way to learn and apply exception handling in C#. You will find practical examples and exercises to enhance your skills.

## Course Overview

The course covers:

- **Understanding Exceptions**: Learn what exceptions are and how they affect your applications.
- **Throwing Exceptions**: Discover how to throw exceptions when something goes wrong.
- **Catching Exceptions**: Master the `try-catch` blocks to manage errors effectively.
- **Building Resilient APIs**: Learn how to create APIs that can handle errors gracefully.
- **Best Practices**: Understand the best practices for exception handling in C#.

## Key Concepts

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is a critical part of writing reliable software. In C#, exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. By learning how to handle exceptions, you can ensure that your application behaves predictably, even when things go wrong.

### Error Hierarchy

Understanding the hierarchy of errors helps you manage exceptions better. C# has a structured way of categorizing exceptions. By grasping this hierarchy, you can create more specific error handling mechanisms.

### APIs and Exceptions

When building APIs, it is essential to handle exceptions properly. A well-designed API should return meaningful error messages and status codes to the client. This section of the course focuses on integrating exception handling into your API design.

### Best Practices

The course emphasizes best practices for exception handling, including:

- Always catch specific exceptions rather than general ones.
- Use logging to track exceptions.
- Provide user-friendly error messages.
- Avoid using exceptions for flow control.
